## Hi there 👋

## Who I am, what I do and what I've done

I'm a 3rd semester computer Science student with deep interest in Data Science. Proactivity, commitment and focus are part of my profile. I'm constantly seeking technical knowledge and developing interpersonal skills, to one day be an exceptional leader.

Currently, I participate in the “Comunidade DS”, a private community for data scientists, where I have been acquiring the necessary skills to enter the data area, and also making portfolio projects. In addition, I consume other courses, videos, books, articles and all kinds of materials that are useful to my study. Every day i'm developing the capability of learning anything by myself.

As previous experience, I already done two summer internships in BTG Pactual, both working with Data Science projects.
* In the first one I worked on the development of a multi-class classification model to recommend a financial product category for a client's first investment.
* In the next, I worked on the development of a machine learning model to act in fraud prevention during the customer onboarding stage (account opening).

In addition to Data Science experiences, due to the fact that my college is based on 10-week projects for real companies (Hurb, Klabin, Estapar....), I have already had practical contact with different areas such as: IoT, Web Development, Operational Research, Algorithms. All these projects gave me not only technical knowledge about these areas, but also helped me a lot to develop personal skills (communication, colaboration, leadership) and project development skills like: Scrum, Time Managment, Product Discovery, User Understanding and many others.

Not only looking at technology skills, I also participated in Inteli's entrepreneurship league as commercial director for 2 years and participated as an influencer and college ambassador for 1 year. In addition, I was a monitor of more than 5 short courses on Marketing, Sales and Administration at ESPM, helping more than 200 students during their journeys in the courses. 

In my high school I was president for 1 year, and I worked as a member for another year of the Interact Club São Caetano do Sul Olímpico, a voluntary organization of young people, promoting various social works, such as donating blankets and clothes, collecting food for animals and others.

Recently, I participate on Inteli's Blockchain Challenge, where me and my group developed functional platform that generates a complete report of a given crypto asset using artificial intelligence, based on different sources of information (news, social networks, data from brokers...). With this project, we won 1st place in the Titanium Asset category. In addition to the $2000 prize pool, we took home a lot of knowledge and personal development.

All these experiences helped me to develop communication, understanding and managing people, resilience, emotional managment, colaboration and critical thinking.


## Tools

Data Science:
* Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, seaborn, POO)
* Statistics 
* Machine Learning 
* Git and Virtual Environments 
* AWS (Athena, Sagemaker, S3) 
* Web Scraping
* SQL

In general, I have intermediary level in the above skills, I judge the necessary for starting generating value for companies through Data Science projects.
 
Web development:
* Javascript
* NodeJS
* HTML, CSS 
* MongoDB 
* API's

I see tools as what they are: TOOLS.

If necessary to learn and develop any other skill, I have the willingness and ability to do so.


## Data Science Portfolio

#### Health Insurance Cross Sell

Casado Insurance is a B2C company whose core business is offering health insurance to individuals. Now it plans to implement a cross sell strategy focused on distribuiting car insurance to its customer base. Given that the budget for the sales is limited, it is necessary to prioritize those customers who are more likely to purchase the product. Then, a Data Scientist was consulted to build a machine learning model to order the customer base by propensity score.

#### Airbnb First Booking Prediction (:hammer_and_wrench:)

In this project, we are given a list of users along with their demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics. We have to predict which country a new user's first booking destination will be. This is useful for the business because if we can have some control of our demand, we can also promote more offer in determined location and make more effective marketing campaings, reducing CAC.
